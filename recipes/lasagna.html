    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special 
            homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
            made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a 
            deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling 
            would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe 
            calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese 
            and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. 
            Serve with a leafy green salad and 
            crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts 
                    with a pound of ground meat 
                    (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
                <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</p></li>
                <li><p> Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</p></li>
                <li><p> the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</p></li>
                <li><p> Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</p></li>
